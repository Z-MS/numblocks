NumBlocks is a small app that can help kids learn how to recognise numbers ðŸ™‚.

The numbers are arranged in colourful blocks to grab kids attention.

*Numblocks App*	




**New Feature:** You can change the colours of the blocks so children can stay interested and have something to play with. You can also use the colour changing feature to teach them about colours ðŸ˜€.

## Set up NumBlocks on your local machine
Numblocks was built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript; It doesn't use any frameworks, so setting it up is easy.

**NOTE: The code for the feature flag that toggles the color change feature is in the `scripts.js` file**
