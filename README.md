# numblocks
Numblocks is a small app that can help kids learn how to recognise numbers ğŸ™‚.
The numbers are arranged in colourful blocks to grab kids attention.
**New Feature:** You can change the colours of the blocks so children can stay interested and have something to play with. You can also use the colour changing feature to teach them about colours ğŸ˜€.
