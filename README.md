Numblocks is a small app that can help kids learn how to recognise numbers ðŸ™‚.

The numbers are arranged in colourful blocks to grab kids attention.

## Set up NumBlocks on your local mahine
Numblocks was built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript; It doesn't use any frameworks, so setting it up is easy.

If you want to run Numblocks on your computer, you can click the Code button on the Github page. You will see the option to Clone, Open with Github Desktop, or Download the project as a ZIP file. I will cover how to Clone and Download ZIP.

### To Clone:
The easiest option is Cloning. Just copy the link specified in the text field, Open the command line on your computer, paste the link you copied and run the command.

### To Download ZIP:
Alternatively, you can choose download the ZIP file. Once the download is complete, you can use compression programs like WinRAR or 7Zip to extract the files. Select extract and it will create a folder named numblocks with the code files in them. Open `index.html` to run the app. It doesn't need a server to run, your local file system will suffice in this case.
